# **Project Blueprint: Predicting Gene Co-expression in *Arabidopsis thaliana* via TF Binding Signatures**

## **A. Project Objective and Rationale**

The primary objective of this project is to conceptualize, develop, and implement a sophisticated machine learning model, specifically leveraging a transformer architecture, to predict gene co-expression patterns in the model plant species *Arabidopsis thaliana*. This predictive capability will be fundamentally driven by the analysis of Transcription Factor (TF) binding profiles. These profiles will be meticulously mapped within precisely defined promoter regions, spanning from \-2000 base pairs (bp) upstream to \+500 bp downstream relative to the annotated start codon of each gene. The TF binding data will be sourced from DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (DAP-seq) experiments encompassing approximately 300 distinct TFs. A central innovative component of this endeavor is the exploration and learning of a "TF vocabulary." This vocabulary aims to encapsulate combinatorial TF binding patterns occurring within localized 50bp windows along the promoter sequences, reflecting the complex interplay of TFs in gene regulation.

The significance of this project lies in the fundamental importance of understanding gene co-expression to unravel the intricacies of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), identify functional gene modules, and delineate cellular pathways.1 Transcription factors are the linchpins in the orchestra of gene expression.1 Their specific binding to *cis*\-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters, dictates the transcriptional landscape of a cell. Therefore, the ability to predict gene co-expression based on the nuanced patterns of TF binding can illuminate novel regulatory relationships and significantly enhance our comprehension of how complex biological traits and environmental responses are genetically governed. *Arabidopsis thaliana* serves as an exemplary model system for such an investigation, owing to its extensive and well-curated genomic resources. This includes a wealth of DAP-seq data, which provides genome-wide *in vitro* binding evidence for a substantial collection of TFs, forming a solid foundation for building predictive models.5

## **B. Core Strategies and Innovations**

The project is built upon several core strategies designed to maximize predictive power and biological relevance, incorporating innovative elements to address the complexities of gene regulation:

1. **Standardized Promoter Definition:** The consistent definition of promoter regions as \-2000bp to \+500bp around the start codon ensures a uniform genomic context for analyzing TF binding across all genes. This standardization is crucial for comparative analysis and model training.  
2. **Quantitative TF Binding Profiles from DAP-seq:** The utilization of quantitative DAP-seq bigWig files provides genome-wide, *in vitro* TF binding evidence. This approach offers a direct measure of TF-DNA interaction strength, initially circumventing the complexities of *in vivo* chromatin states and co-factor availability, thereby providing a baseline understanding of sequence-specific binding preferences.5  
3. **Leveraging Existing Co-expression Data for Training:** The model will be trained using a pre-existing Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file detailing known co-expressed gene pairs. The acknowledgment that this dataset is "possibly incomplete" is a pragmatic recognition of real-world data limitations and underscores the need for a modeling approach that is robust to such imperfections.  
4. **Tokenized Feature Engineering:** A key innovation is the tokenization of features using a sliding window approach. This strategy aims to decipher a local "TF vocabulary" or regulatory syntax by aggregating TF binding signals within 50bp windows. This approach moves beyond simple TF presence/absence by considering the local context and interplay of multiple TFs. The model's success will hinge on its capacity to discern which "words" (aggregated TF signals within a window) are significantly associated with gene co-expression.
5. **Transformer Model Architecture:** The selection of a transformer model is strategically driven by its demonstrated prowess in capturing positional importance and long-range dependencies within sequential data.11 This characteristic is directly pertinent to understanding the arrangement and functional significance of TF binding sites and the learned "TF vocabulary" elements distributed across promoter regions. The transformer is not merely processing an unordered set of TFs; it is expected to learn the significance of their specific arrangement and spacing. For instance, the regulatory implication of TF A followed closely by TF B might differ substantially from TF B preceding TF A, or from the two TFs being separated by a larger distance within the promoter. The self-attention mechanisms inherent in transformers are well-suited to learn these nuanced positional dependencies.  
6. **Planned Future Generalization:** The project incorporates a forward-looking perspective, aiming for future generalization of the developed model to other plant species. This extension is envisioned to leverage single-cell data, indicating a long-term goal of achieving broader applicability and enhanced resolution in understanding plant gene regulation across diverse contexts.

The "TF vocabulary" can be conceptualized as a proxy for the local regulatory grammar embedded within promoter sequences. The 50bp window defines the spatial extent of this grammar, focusing on immediate TF-TF interactions or closely positioned binding sites. The transformer architecture is then tasked with interpreting this grammar, understanding how the sequence and combination of these vocabulary elements across the entire promoter contribute to the likelihood of co-expression. Given that the training labels (co-expressed gene pairs) are "possibly incomplete," implying the presence of noisy or missing positive labels, a robustly learned TF vocabulary becomes even more critical. Such a vocabulary, capturing generalizable rules of TF interaction for co-regulation, would be more powerful than attempting to memorize TF binding profiles for only the known co-expressed pairs. This necessitates that the model learns the underlying regulatory logic encoded in the TF vocabulary, rather than merely correlating complex TF binding landscapes with a potentially sparse set of known co-expressed gene pairs.

## **C. Anticipated Challenges**

Several challenges are anticipated in the execution of this project:

1. **Incomplete Training Data:** The "possibly incomplete" nature of the co-expressed gene pairs TSV poses a significant challenge. This incompleteness means the training data will likely contain false negatives (true co-expressed pairs not labeled as such). This can bias the model and hinder its ability to generalize. Strategies for robust negative sampling and potentially techniques for learning with noisy labels will be essential (addressed further in Section V).  
2. ***In Vitro*** **vs. *In Vivo* Discrepancies:** DAP-seq data, being generated *in vitro*, measures the intrinsic binding affinity of TFs to naked DNA. It may not fully recapitulate *in vivo* binding patterns, which are influenced by factors such as chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation (though DAP-seq can be adapted to study methylation sensitivity 5), the presence and activity of co-factors, and competitive or cooperative interactions with other DNA-binding proteins.5 While starting with *in vitro* data provides a cleaner signal of sequence preference, careful interpretation is needed, and future integration of *in vivo* datasets (e.g., ATAC-seq) might be necessary to refine predictions.  
3. **High Dimensionality of Data:** The TF binding data will comprise signals from approximately 300 TFs across thousands of genes, with promoter regions of 2501bp. This high dimensionality necessitates efficient computational methods for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.  
4. **Complexity of "TF Vocabulary" Learning:** Defining and learning a biologically meaningful and predictive "TF vocabulary" is a non-trivial pattern recognition task. The representation of these vocabulary elements and their integration into the transformer model will be critical.  
5. **Model Interpretability:** While transformers are powerful, interpreting their decision-making processes (e.g., understanding which TF combinations or positions are most influential) can be challenging, yet it is crucial for deriving biological insights.

# II. Foundational Knowledge: Review of Relevant Research and Methodologies

A thorough understanding of existing research and methodologies is crucial for contextualizing the proposed project and leveraging established best practices. This section reviews literature pertinent to predicting gene co-expression from TF binding data, the application of transformer architectures in genomics, the use of DAP-seq for TF profiling, and approaches to deciphering TF combinatorial logic.

## **A. Approaches for Predicting Gene Co-expression and Regulatory Networks from TF Binding Data**

Predicting gene co-expression and inferring the structure of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from TF binding data are central pursuits in computational systems biology. Genes that are co-expressed are frequently involved in related biological functions and are often subject to common regulatory mechanisms.1 The binding of TFs to CREs is a primary mechanistic driver of this co-regulation.1

Various computational strategies have been developed to link TF binding to gene regulation:

* **Enrichment-Based Methods:** Tools such as TF2Network exemplify this approach. They predict TF regulators for a given set of co-expressed or functionally related genes by assessing the statistical enrichment of known TF binding sites (TFBSs) within their promoter regions.1 While valuable for hypothesis generation, these methods typically rely on pre-existing knowledge of TFBS motifs and often analyze enrichment across a gene set rather than predicting pairwise co-expression directly from raw TF binding profiles, as intended in the current project.  
* **General Machine Learning (ML) Approaches:** ML, particularly deep learning (DL), is increasingly employed to predict gene expression levels or identify regulatory interactions using diverse genomic features.4  
  * The TEPIC method, for instance, utilizes TF affinities derived from computational predictions alongside open-chromatin signals (e.g., DNase-seq) within an ML framework to explain variability in gene expression, underscoring the utility of quantitative binding information.17  
  * RiceTFtarget integrates co-expression data, sequence pattern matching, and ML (specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs) for predicting TF-target interactions in rice, demonstrating the benefit of combining multiple data modalities.18  
  * Several studies have explored the use of deep learning to predict gene expression levels directly from TFBS data, primarily derived from ChIP-seq experiments.19 Notably, these studies have shown that it's possible to achieve good correlation between predicted and actual expression levels, and even to substitute some TF binding data with co-expression data as input features, further supporting the feasibility of linking TF binding patterns to expression phenomena.  
  * Work by Keagy et al. 16 applied CNNs to predict differential gene expression in *A. thaliana* using DNA sequences as input. They reported moderate accuracy and highlighted challenges such as the inherent biological complexity of regulation. The current project builds upon such efforts by focusing on TF binding profiles (which are arguably more direct functional features for a TF-centric co-regulation question than raw DNA sequence alone) and employing transformer models, which may offer advantages in capturing complex dependencies.  
* **Graph-Based Models:** Given that GRNs are inherently network structures, graph-based modeling approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are gaining traction for GRN inference and gene expression prediction. These methods can explicitly leverage the topological properties of regulatory networks.24 While the immediate goal of this project is pairwise co-expression prediction, the output could subsequently be used to construct a co-expression network. GNNs might become relevant for future extensions, such as integrating prior GRN knowledge or analyzing the properties of the predicted network. For example, one study successfully used an *A. thaliana* regulatory network structure to enhance gene expression prediction accuracy in maize.24

These diverse approaches commonly utilize TFBS locations, ChIP-seq or DAP-seq peak data, measures of open chromatin, and DNA sequence motifs as input features.1 The project's plan to use quantitative DAP-seq bigWig profiles as the primary input aligns well with these established data types.

This body of research collectively validates the general premise of using TF binding information to predict various facets of gene regulation, including co-expression. It also highlights a clear trend towards the adoption of more sophisticated ML models, such as deep learning architectures. The current project is positioned at this research frontier, with its innovative focus on learning a "TF vocabulary" from local binding patterns and applying transformer models for direct pairwise co-expression prediction based on these TF binding profiles.

The synergy between DAP-seq's *in vitro* nature and the goal of learning a foundational "TF vocabulary" is noteworthy. DAP-seq primarily measures the intrinsic binding affinity of TFs to DNA sequences, minimizing the influence of *in vivo* confounders like specific chromatin states or the transient availability of co-factors in particular cell types.7 The "TF vocabulary" aims to capture fundamental, sequence-driven TF co-occurrence patterns within defined 50bp windows. Consequently, by using DAP-seq data, the initial "TF vocabulary" learned will predominantly reflect the sequence-based rules governing TF assembly on DNA, rather than being overly shaped by cell-type-specific chromatin contexts that are not present in the DAP-seq assay. This approach could lead to the identification of a more "universal" TF vocabulary for *A. thaliana*, grounded in DNA sequence preferences. This foundational vocabulary could then be further refined in subsequent studies by integrating *in vivo* data (e.g., ATAC-seq for chromatin accessibility) to understand how chromatin context modulates or gates these intrinsic binding preferences to achieve cell-type-specific co-expression. This establishes a layered and systematic approach to dissecting gene regulation.

## **B. Transformer Architectures in Genomic Sequence Analysis and Gene Expression Modeling**

Transformer models, originally developed for natural language processing (NLP), have precipitated a paradigm shift in that field and are increasingly demonstrating remarkable success in computer vision and other domains. Their core strength lies in the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of an input sequence when making predictions, thereby effectively capturing contextual dependencies, including long-range interactions.11

The application of transformers to genomic data analysis is a burgeoning field, driven by the conceptual analogy between sequences of words in a sentence and sequences of nucleotides, genes, or other genomic features.11 However, adapting transformers to genomics is not without challenges, including the high dimensionality of genomic data, inherent sparsity, and the prevalence of missing values in biological datasets.11

Several transformer-based models have been specifically designed or adapted for gene expression modeling and other genomic tasks:

* **GexBERT:** This model is a transformer-based autoencoder that is pretrained using a masking and restoration objective. This pretraining strategy encourages the model to learn distributed representations (embeddings) of gene expression patterns by predicting masked gene expression values from their surrounding context genes.11 GexBERT is designed to handle continuous gene expression values and has shown strong performance in tasks like pan-cancer classification and survival prediction. Its architecture typically involves an encoder to create gene embeddings and a decoder to reconstruct expression values, utilizing specific gene and value embeddings as input.11 The pretraining on co-expression relationships is particularly relevant to the current project's goals.  
* **T-GEM (Transformer for Gene Expression Modeling):** T-GEM employs self-attention mechanisms to explicitly model gene-gene interactions for tasks such as phenotype prediction.12 It accepts normalized log-transformed gene expression data as input. A key feature of T-GEM is its ability to capture global dependencies and handle unordered inputs (like a set of genes), which is advantageous for genomic data.12 The analysis of attention weights in T-GEM has been suggested as a means to infer co-expression relationships.  
* **Other Genomic Transformers:** Beyond gene expression, models like DNABERT have been adapted from BERT for processing DNA sequences directly, enabling tasks such as splice site prediction.14 SpliceSelectNet utilizes a hierarchical Transformer architecture to capture long-range dependencies in DNA sequences, which are critical for understanding splicing regulation.14 Furthermore, foundational models like Nucleotide Transformers 27 and the Genomic Tokenizer (GT) for BERT-like models 13 are being developed. These aim to learn a fundamental "language of DNA" by pretraining on vast genomic sequence datasets. The Genomic Tokenizer, for example, incorporates biological knowledge by tokenizing DNA based on codons, which is relevant when dealing with gene sequences.

A crucial aspect of transformer models is their inherent ability to handle and represent **positional information**. This is typically achieved through the addition of positional encodings to the input embeddings, allowing the model to understand the order and relative positions of elements in a sequence. This is of paramount importance for the current project, which aims to understand the arrangement of TFBSs and the "TF vocabulary" elements within promoter regions.

For tasks involving paired inputs, such as predicting a relationship or similarity between two entities, **Siamese network architectures** offer a compelling design pattern. A Siamese network consists of two (or more) identical subnetworks that share the same weights. Each subnetwork processes one of the inputs independently, and their outputs are then combined and compared to make a final prediction.29 FactorNet, for instance, uses a Siamese architecture for predicting TF binding by comparing sequence inputs.29 This architectural concept is highly relevant to the user's goal of predicting co-expression between *pairs* of genes. A Siamese transformer could be designed where each "twin" processes the promoter TF binding profile of one gene, and their representations are subsequently compared to predict co-expression status. 30 describes such a Siamese transformer for change detection in remote sensing images, illustrating the general applicability of the architectural principle.

The literature strongly supports the choice of a transformer model for this project, given its capabilities in handling sequential data and positional dependencies. The successes of models like GexBERT and T-GEM in related gene expression and interaction tasks are encouraging. Furthermore, the Siamese transformer architecture appears to be a particularly well-suited framework for the paired gene input structure of the co-expression prediction problem. Pretraining strategies, such as the masking and restoration objective used by GexBERT, could potentially be adapted for learning robust representations of TF binding profiles before fine-tuning on the co-expression prediction task.

The "possibly incomplete" nature of the co-expression training data can be viewed as a form of weak supervision. This situation implicitly pushes the model to learn robust and generalizable rules, embodied in the "TF vocabulary," rather than simply memorizing patterns from a potentially flawed dataset. If the model were to attempt direct, complex mappings from entire promoter TF binding landscapes to these incomplete labels, it would risk overfitting to the known pairs or learning spurious correlations based on the missing information. The intermediate step of learning a "TF vocabulary" – representing local TF combinations – compels the model to identify lower-dimensional features that are more broadly indicative of co-regulation. The model must therefore distill robust signals from this noisy and incomplete supervision by identifying TF vocabulary elements that are consistently associated with the *observed* co-expressed pairs, with the hope that these elements represent true underlying regulatory logic. This makes the "TF vocabulary" more than just a feature engineering step; it becomes a crucial mechanism for extracting meaningful patterns from imperfect data. This aligns with findings where neural networks demonstrated robustness to mis-annotated negative labels by learning underlying patterns in other biological prediction tasks.32

A potential architectural convergence for this project involves a Siamese transformer design for the paired gene inputs. Each arm of the Siamese network would process a promoter, which itself is represented by its sequence of "TF vocabulary" elements (derived from the 50bp window analysis). The transformer encoders within each arm, sharing weights, would learn to extract relevant features from these promoter TF profiles in a consistent manner. The outputs of these two arms would then be combined (e.g., through a difference, concatenation, or similarity layer) and fed to a final classifier to predict the co-expression status. This architecture explicitly models the comparison of two genes, focusing the learning process on identifying shared or complementary TF binding patterns that are indicative of co-regulation.

## **C. DAP-seq for Genome-Wide TF Binding Profiling in *A. thaliana***

DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (DAP-seq) is a powerful and widely used *in vitro* method for identifying TFBSs on a genome-wide scale.5 The technique involves incubating affinity-tagged TFs, expressed *in vitro*, with fragmented genomic DNA. The TF-DNA complexes are then purified using the affinity tag, and the bound DNA fragments are subsequently eluted, sequenced, and mapped back to the reference genome to identify regions of TF binding.

DAP-seq offers several advantages for TF binding studies:

* **High-Throughput and Scalability:** It can be applied to a large number of TFs relatively quickly, as demonstrated by studies that have profiled hundreds of TFs in *A. thaliana*.5  
* **No Antibody Requirement:** Unlike Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), DAP-seq does not require the generation of specific, high-quality antibodies for each TF, which can be a significant bottleneck, especially for less-studied proteins or across different species.7  
* **Baseline Binding Preferences:** Being an *in vitro* assay, DAP-seq primarily measures the intrinsic affinity of a TF for DNA sequences, largely independent of *in vivo* complexities such as chromatin structure, nucleosome occupancy, or the presence of specific co-factors in a particular cell type.7 This can be an advantage for understanding the fundamental sequence preferences of a TF, but it is also a limitation when trying to infer direct *in vivo* regulatory roles without considering cellular context.  
* **Resolution and Motif Discovery:** DAP-seq can resolve TFBSs into discrete genomic peaks and the resulting sequence data can be used for accurate *de novo* motif discovery or to confirm known binding motifs.5  
* **Application in *A. thaliana*:** Extensive DAP-seq datasets have been generated for *A. thaliana*, providing a rich resource for studying its regulatory landscape. For example, the dataset GSE60141 provides binding motifs for 529 TFs and genome-wide enrichment maps for 349 TFs.5

The output of DAP-seq experiments typically includes files indicating peak locations (e.g., BED files) and quantitative signal enrichment values across the genome, often provided as bigWig files, which is the format specified in the user query for this project.5

However, certain considerations are important when using DAP-seq data:

* ***In Vitro*** **Limitations:** The *in vitro* nature means that DAP-seq does not capture the influence of the *in vivo* cellular environment. Factors like chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation (though DAP-seq can be modified to investigate methylation sensitivity 5), interactions with other proteins, and TF competition for binding sites are not inherently part of the standard assay.5  
* **Data Analysis Tools:** Several tools and platforms facilitate the analysis of DAP-seq data. For instance, iRegNet is a web application that integrates *A. thaliana* ChIP-seq and DAP-seq data to help researchers analyze regulatory networks.6 Commercial services also offer comprehensive DAP-seq data analysis, including peak calling, motif discovery, and annotation.7

For this project, DAP-seq is a highly suitable and well-documented source for obtaining TF binding profiles in *A. thaliana*, aligning with the project's specifications. The availability of quantitative data in bigWig format simplifies the process of extracting continuous binding signals. The *in vitro* nature of the data implies that the "TF vocabulary" learned will primarily reflect sequence-driven affinities and local TF-DNA interaction propensities. This can be viewed as a "clean" starting point, establishing a baseline of potential interactions before layering on the complexities of the *in vivo* environment.

## **D. Deciphering TF Combinatorial Logic: Cooperativity and "TF Vocabulary"**

Gene regulation in eukaryotes is rarely the result of a single TF acting in isolation. Instead, it is a highly combinatorial process where multiple TFs interact with each other and with DNA to achieve precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression.8

TF Cooperativity and Combinatorial Binding:  
TFs often bind to DNA cooperatively, meaning the binding of one TF to its site can enhance or stabilize the binding of another TF to a nearby site. This cooperativity can be mediated by direct protein-protein interactions between TFs, or indirectly through TF-induced changes in DNA conformation or by shared co-activators/co-repressors.8 Given that eukaryotic TFs frequently recognize relatively short and somewhat degenerate DNA sequence motifs, combinatorial binding and cooperativity are essential mechanisms for achieving the high degree of specificity required to regulate thousands of genes accurately within large genomes.3 Regulatory decisions are often executed by specific combinations of TFs binding in concert to CREs within promoter or enhancer regions.8 Consequently, identifying these TF combinations and understanding the syntax of their binding motif arrangements (e.g., spacing, orientation) is a key challenge in understanding gene regulatory codes.35 Early work by Pilpel et al. 8 attempted to correlate computationally derived motif combinations with gene expression data, pioneering this line of inquiry.  
Computational Approaches to Identify Co-binding and "TF Vocabulary":  
The project's proposal to learn a "TF 'vocabulary' for combinations within 50bp" aligns directly with the concept of local combinatorial control. This "vocabulary" aims to:

1. Identify which TFs (or their binding signals) frequently co-occur within short (50bp) segments of promoter DNA.  
2. Implicitly capture the spatial constraints, such as relative positions and spacing, of these co-occurring TF binding events.  
3. Treat these specific local combinations of TFs as distinct units of regulatory information – analogous to "words" or "phrases" in a regulatory language.

Several computational methods have been developed to explore TF co-binding:

* **COBIND:** This method employs Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) applied to one-hot encoded DNA sequences flanking known TFBSs. Its goal is to identify enriched DNA patterns (potential co-binding motifs) that occur at fixed distances from an "anchor" TFBS.10 The output of COBIND includes these co-binding motifs and information about their spacing relative to the anchor site. While COBIND identifies these patterns, it does not explicitly detail how these structured outputs (motif and spacing) could be vectorized for input into downstream machine learning models like transformers, a gap the current project implicitly aims to address by learning representations of such local combinations.  
* **COPS (Co-Occurrence Pattern Search):** This tool uses a combination of association rule mining and Markov chain models to detect statistically significant co-occurrences of TFBSs within genomic regions of interest. Notably, COPS also attempts to identify preferred short distances (spatial arrangements) between these co-occurring TF motifs, emphasizing that such spatial information is critical for the activity of CRMs.36  
* **PTFSpot:** This recent transformer-based model for predicting TF binding regions (TFBRs) in plants uses k-mer "words" of varying lengths (dimeric, pentameric, heptameric) extracted from DNA sequences as input.37 These k-mers are tokenized and embedded before being fed into the transformer. This approach implicitly captures local sequence patterns and their surrounding context, which is highly analogous to the "TF vocabulary" concept proposed here. The transformer then learns the significance of these k-mer patterns and their arrangements.

Representing TF Co-occurrence for Deep Learning:  
The representation of TF co-occurrence and local binding patterns for input into deep learning models is a critical step. COBIND uses one-hot encoded DNA sequences of flanking regions.10 PTFSpot tokenizes its k-mer "words" into integer IDs and then learns embeddings for these tokens.37 More generally, learning embeddings from co-occurrence data, as exemplified by algorithms like Swivel (which generates embeddings from a feature co-occurrence matrix 38), is a viable strategy that could be adapted to represent the "TF vocabulary" elements.  
The existing literature strongly supports the rationale behind the "TF vocabulary" approach. The choice of a 50bp window provides a practical definition of local context for TF combinations, aiming to capture interactions between immediately adjacent or very closely positioned TFs. The primary challenge will be to effectively represent these vocabulary elements and their inherent spatial relationships in a manner that is amenable to processing by the transformer architecture. The k-mer tokenization and embedding strategy used by PTFSpot offers a promising precedent. The transformer's self-attention mechanism is then well-suited to learn the importance of different learned "vocabulary" elements and their arrangement across the broader promoter region.

The 50bp window size specified for defining the TF vocabulary elements is a critical hyperparameter that balances the need to capture local interactions against the risk of excessive combinatorial complexity. This window size effectively defines the "granularity" of the learned regulatory syntax. If the window is too small, important cooperative interactions involving multiple TFs might be fragmented and missed. Conversely, if the window is too large, the concept of a truly local syntax might be diluted, and the number of potential TF combinations within such a large window could become computationally prohibitive to learn or represent effectively. The 50bp choice likely aims to capture interactions between TFs that are immediately adjacent or very closely positioned, which is consistent with many known examples of TF cooperativity. It is important to recognize that longer-range interactions, such as those between TFs separated by more than 50bp within the promoter, or interactions between distal enhancers and promoters, would not be directly captured by individual "vocabulary" elements defined this way. Instead, the transformer model, by processing sequences of these 50bp window-derived elements, would be responsible for learning these broader contextual relationships across the promoter.

# III. Implementation Roadmap for the Coding Agent

This section outlines a detailed plan for the coding agent, covering the recommended software stack, a step-by-step data processing pipeline, transformer model development, and strategies for visualization and interpretation.

## **A. Recommended Software, Libraries, and Computational Environment**

A robust and reproducible computational environment is foundational to the success of this project. Python (version 3.8 or higher is recommended) will serve as the core programming language, primarily due to its extensive ecosystem of libraries tailored for bioinformatics, data science, and deep learning.

**Key Python Libraries:**

* **Bioinformatics & Genomics:**  
  * Biopython: Essential for parsing GFF3 files (gene annotations) and FASTA files (genome sequences), as well as general biological sequence manipulation.39  
  * pyBigWig: A highly efficient library for reading and extracting quantitative signal data from bigWig files (DAP-seq TF binding profiles).40 It allows for precise querying of genomic intervals. metaseq 42 is an alternative but pyBigWig is often favored for its directness.  
  * gffpandas 43 or GFF3toolkit 44: These libraries offer functionalities for working with GFF3 files, potentially providing convenient DataFrame-based manipulation (gffpandas) or validation/fixing capabilities (GFF3toolkit), which can supplement Biopython's parsing. Custom scripts utilizing pandas for GFF3 manipulation are also an option. While promoterExtract 45 is a specialized tool for promoter extraction, a more general GFF parsing capability will likely be more flexible.  
* **Data Manipulation & Numerical Computation:**  
  * pandas: Indispensable for handling tabular data, such as the input co-expressed gene pairs TSV file, managing metadata, and creating structured representations of processed data.46  
  * NumPy: The cornerstone for numerical computation in Python, providing support for efficient multi-dimensional arrays and a vast array of mathematical operations crucial for machine learning.  
  * SciPy: Offers a wide range of scientific and technical computing capabilities, including statistical functions that may be useful during data analysis, normalization, or evaluation.  
* **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:**  
  * PyTorch (recommended due to its flexibility in research settings and dynamic graph capabilities) or TensorFlow/Keras: These are the leading deep learning frameworks for building, training, and deploying the transformer model. Both provide robust support for custom model architectures, automatic differentiation, and GPU acceleration. The PTFSpot model, which shares conceptual similarities with the "TF vocabulary" approach, was implemented in PyTorch \[18 (CNN context), 37 (transformer)\]. GexBERT implementations also commonly use these frameworks.  
  * scikit-learn: A comprehensive machine learning library useful for tasks such as data splitting (train/validation/test sets), calculating various performance metrics (e.g., AUPRC, F1-score, AUC-ROC), and potentially for implementing baseline machine learning models for comparison or specific preprocessing steps like data scaling (though normalization of genomic signals often requires more specialized approaches). The COBIND method, for example, utilizes scikit-learn's NMF implementation.10  
* **Visualization:**  
  * Matplotlib and Seaborn: Standard Python libraries for creating a wide range of static, publication-quality plots, including loss curves during model training, performance metric visualizations (ROC/PR curves), and distributions of TF binding signals.  
  * Specialized genomic visualization tools or custom plotting scripts might be necessary for more advanced visualizations, such as rendering attention maps from the transformer model in a genomic context (e.g., overlaying attention scores on promoter regions in a genome browser-like view).

**Computational Environment:**

* **Operating System:** A Linux-based operating system is highly recommended due to its widespread adoption in the bioinformatics community and superior compatibility with most scientific computing tools and High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environments.  
* **Hardware:**  
  * **CPUs:** Multi-core processors are essential for efficiently parallelizing data preprocessing tasks, which can be computationally intensive.  
  * **RAM:** A substantial amount of RAM (e.g., 64GB or more, depending on the full dataset size and processing batch sizes) will be required for loading and manipulating large genomic datasets and TF binding matrices.  
  * **GPUs:** High-performance GPUs are critical for training transformer models in a reasonable timeframe. NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., A100, V100, or modern RTX series) with ample VRAM (e.g., 16GB+) are recommended.  
* **Software Management:** The use of conda (Anaconda/Miniconda) or virtualenv in conjunction with pip is crucial for managing Python environments and dependencies. This ensures reproducibility by isolating project-specific library versions and preventing conflicts.  
* **Version Control:** Git should be used for rigorous version control of all code, scripts, and configuration files, facilitating collaboration, tracking changes, and enabling rollbacks if necessary.

A consolidated list of these core software components is provided in Table 1\. This table serves as a practical checklist for the coding agent when establishing the development environment, aiming to standardize the software stack and minimize potential issues related to dependencies or version incompatibilities.

**1\. Promoter Region Definition and Sequence Extraction**

* **Inputs:**  
  * *A. thaliana* genome annotation file in GFF3 format (e.g., from TAIR or Ensembl Plants).  
  * Corresponding *A. thaliana* genome sequence in FASTA format.  
* **Process:**  
  1. **Parse GFF3 File:** Utilize a GFF3 parser (e.g., Biopython.GFF.parse 39 or gffpandas 43\) to iterate through the annotation file. Identify entries corresponding to protein-coding genes. For each gene, extract its unique identifier (e.g., TAIR AGI code), chromosome, strand, and the coordinates of its start codon (translation start site, TSS). The GFF3toolkit 44 can be used for initial validation or fixing of the GFF3 file if issues are suspected.  
  2. **Define Promoter Coordinates:** For each identified gene, define its promoter region as the genomic interval spanning from 2000bp upstream to 500bp downstream of its start codon. It is crucial to handle strand specificity correctly: for genes on the '+' strand, upstream will be coordinates numerically smaller than the start codon; for genes on the '-' strand, upstream will be coordinates numerically larger. The total length of this defined region is 2501bp.  
  3. **Extract Promoter Sequences:** Using the chromosome and calculated promoter coordinates, extract the corresponding DNA sequences from the genome FASTA file (e.g., using Biopython.SeqIO to parse the FASTA file and a custom function or bedtools getfasta principles to extract specific regions).  
  4. **Store Data:** Store the extracted promoter sequences, ensuring each sequence is clearly associated with its corresponding gene ID, chromosome, strand, and start/end coordinates. A structured format like a TSV or FASTA file with descriptive headers is recommended for this intermediate output.  
* **Tools:** Biopython, potentially gffpandas or command-line bedtools (via subprocess module if necessary for specific operations, though direct Python manipulation is preferred for integration).

**2\. TF Binding Profile Extraction and Quantification from DAP-seq bigWig Files**

* **Inputs:**  
  * A collection of DAP-seq bigWig files, one for each of the \~300 *A. thaliana* TFs.  
  * The list of gene IDs and their corresponding promoter coordinates (chromosome, start, end, strand) generated in step III.B.1.  
* **Process:**  
  1. **Iterate Through Genes and TFs:** For each gene's defined promoter region and for each of the \~300 TF DAP-seq bigWig files:  
  2. **Extract Quantitative Signal:** Use a library like pyBigWig 40 to open the relevant bigWig file. For the specific promoter interval (chromosome, start, end), extract the quantitative binding signal. This could be:  
     * **Base-pair resolution signal:** Using pyBigWig.values(chrom, start, end) to get an array of signal values, one for each base pair in the 2501bp promoter region.  
     * **Binned signal (if desired for initial exploration, but base-pair is preferred for vocabulary):** Using pyBigWig.stats(chrom, start, end, type="mean", nBins=num\_bins) to get averaged signals over specified bins. However, for constructing the 50bp TF vocabulary, maintaining higher resolution initially is better. metaseq 42 also offers functionalities to create arrays of genomic signals.  
  3. **Handle Strand:** While DAP-seq signals are typically unstranded (reflecting binding to dsDNA), ensure consistency if any strand-specific processing was applied during bigWig generation. For this project, the signal is usually considered irrespective of gene strand for TF binding.  
  4. **Store Profiles:** For each gene, this process will result in a collection of numerical vectors (one vector per TF, of length 2501\) or a matrix of size (Number of TFs x 2501). This raw signal matrix needs to be stored efficiently, perhaps gene by gene or in larger batches.  
* **Output:** A structured dataset (e.g., a collection of NumPy arrays or a multi-level dictionary) containing the raw TF binding signal profiles for each gene's promoter region across all \~300 TFs.

**3\. Normalization and Bias Correction of TF Binding Signals**

* **Rationale:** Raw DAP-seq signals can be affected by various technical biases, including differences in sequencing depth between experiments (different TF DAP-seq runs), non-specific DNA binding, variations in DNA fragmentability during library preparation (if fragmentation occurs before TF incubation), and potential GC content biases.50 Normalization is critical to make signals comparable across different TFs and different genes, and to ensure that the machine learning model learns true biological patterns rather than technical artifacts.  
* **Methods to Consider and Implement:**  
  1. **Library Size / Sequencing Depth Normalization:**  
     * Calculate a scaling factor for each TF's bigWig file. This could be based on the total number of mapped reads in the experiment or the total signal sum within all defined promoter regions (or a set of reference regions).  
     * Divide all signal values in a bigWig file by its corresponding scaling factor (e.g., reads per million, RPM). 50 discusses the choice between "full" library size and "effective" library size (reads in features of interest).  
  2. **Background/Input Control Subtraction (Highly Recommended if data is available):**  
     * If control DAP-seq experiments (e.g., using mock IP with beads only, or genomic DNA input without a specific TF) are available as bigWig files, their signals can be used to estimate background noise.  
     * Normalize the control bigWig(s) similarly to the TF bigWigs.  
     * Subtract the (scaled) control signal from the (scaled) TF signal at each genomic position. This helps to remove regions of consistently high signal due to accessibility or other non-specific effects.50 Handle negative values post-subtraction (e.g., by setting them to zero).  
  3. **Per-TF Scaling/Standardization:**  
     * After depth normalization and background subtraction (if applicable), signals for different TFs might still exist on very different scales.  
     * For each TF, consider standardizing its signal across all gene promoters (e.g., Z-score normalization: subtract mean and divide by standard deviation of that TF's signal across all promoters). This brings each TF's signal distribution to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1\.  
     * Alternatively, Min-Max scaling could transform signals for each TF to a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 1).  
  4. **Log Transformation:** Consider applying a log transformation (e.g., log2​(x+1)) to the signals, especially if they are highly skewed. This can stabilize variance and make distributions more symmetric, which can be beneficial for some ML models. 59 mentions using log2-transformed normalized read counts for DAP-seq correlation analysis.  
* **Chosen Strategy:** A multi-step approach is advisable:  
  * First, normalize for sequencing depth for each TF bigWig.  
  * Second, if input controls are available, subtract the normalized input signal.  
  * Third, apply a transformation like log2​(x+c) (where c is a small pseudocount) to handle zeros and reduce skewness.  
  * Finally, perform Z-score normalization for each TF's signal across all gene promoters.  
* **Documentation:** The exact normalization pipeline chosen must be meticulously documented, as it significantly impacts downstream analysis.

**4\. Co-expressed Gene Pair Dataset Preparation**

* **Input:** The Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file containing known co-expressed gene pairs for *A. thaliana*. Assume columns like Gene1\_ID, Gene2\_ID, and possibly a co-expression score or confidence level.  
* **Process:**  
  1. **Load Data:** Use pandas.read\_csv() with sep='\\t' to load the TSV file into a DataFrame.46  
  2. **Identify Positive Examples:** Gene pairs listed in this file will constitute the positive examples for co-expression (label \= 1).  
  3. **Negative Sampling Strategy (Critical due to "possibly incomplete" positives):**  
     * The primary challenge here is that the absence of a pair in the TSV does not definitively mean it's *not* co-expressed; it could simply be unannotated or fall below an arbitrary threshold in the original co-expression analysis. This means a naive selection of all other pairs as negatives will introduce many false negatives into the training set.  
     * **Recommended Approach:** Randomly sample pairs of genes that are *not* present in the positive set.  
       * **Control Ratio:** The number of negative samples should be carefully chosen relative to the number of positive samples (e.g., 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, or 1:10). This ratio impacts class balance and training. Start with 1:1 or 1:3 and experiment.  
       * **Ensure Validity:** Ensure that sampled negative pairs (GeneA, GeneB) are distinct from (GeneB, GeneA) if the positive list treats them as equivalent. Ensure GeneA\!= GeneB.  
     * **Alternative (More Complex) Strategies (Consider for future iterations):**  
       * If co-expression scores are available, pairs with scores significantly below a confident co-expression threshold could be preferentially sampled as negatives.  
       * Utilize functional annotations (e.g., Gene Ontology). Pairs of genes known to belong to disparate biological pathways or cellular compartments could be considered stronger candidates for negative examples. However, this introduces its own set of assumptions and potential biases.32  
  4. **Create Final Labeled Dataset:** Combine positive and selected negative pairs into a single dataset with columns: Gene1\_ID, Gene2\_ID, Label (1 for co-expressed, 0 for not co-expressed).  
* **Output:** A structured dataset (e.g., pandas DataFrame or TSV file) ready for model training, containing pairs of gene IDs and their corresponding co-expression labels.

The selection of negative samples is a highly sensitive step. Due to the "possibly incomplete" nature of the positive co-expression set, a substantial number of true positive pairs might be inadvertently omitted. If negative samples are chosen purely at random from all pairs not explicitly labeled as positive, a significant portion of these "negative" training instances could, in reality, be true positives (thus becoming false negatives in the training data). This scenario aligns with the challenges of learning with noisy labels or Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning. The model's ultimate performance and the biological validity of its learned features, particularly the "TF vocabulary," will be substantially influenced by the "cleanliness" of the negative set. This underscores the importance of potentially experimenting with different negative sampling strategies and focusing on evaluation metrics like AUPRC that are robust to class imbalance and less sensitive to a high number of true negatives.

**5\. Feature Engineering: Constructing the Tokenized Feature Vectors**

* **Rationale:** The goal is to move beyond raw base-pair level TF binding signals and instead capture local combinatorial TF binding patterns within 50bp windows. This aims to create a sequence of more informative, abstracted features for each promoter. This step serves as a crucial dimensionality reduction and feature abstraction layer, enabling the model to focus on relevant combinatorial signals rather than potentially noisy base-pair level details.  
* **Process (for each gene's promoter):**  
  1. **Input:** The normalized TF binding profile matrix for the gene: (Number of TFs x 2501bp).  
  2. **Define Sliding Windows:** Define 50bp sliding windows across the 2501bp promoter with a chosen stride.  
  3. **Represent Each 50bp Window (Signal Aggregation and Clustering):**  
     * For each 50bp window along a promoter:  
       * Extract the sub-matrix of normalized TF binding signals of size (Number of TFs x 50bp).  
       * For each of the \~300 TFs, calculate an aggregate statistic of its binding signal within this 50bp window (mean, max, or sum).  
       * This results in a single vector of length \~300 (one value per TF) for each 50bp window.  
     * Cluster the aggregated window vectors to create a tokenized representation.  
  4. **Sequence of Window Vectors:** For each gene's promoter, this process generates a tokenized feature vector of shape `(num_windows,)`.  
* **Output:** For each gene, a tokenized feature vector.

This hierarchical processing approach (local aggregation of TF signals into window summaries, followed by global pattern learning across these summaries by the transformer) makes the learning task more tractable and potentially more robust to noise in the fine-grained binding signals. It allows the model to first learn a "language" of local TF modules (the vocabulary elements represented by window summaries) and then the "grammar" of how these modules are arranged across the promoter to influence regulatory outcomes.

## **C. Transformer Model Development for Co-expression Prediction**

With the processed data in hand, the next phase is to develop and train the transformer model. A Siamese architecture is recommended to handle the paired gene inputs effectively.

**1\. Input Representation for Paired Gene Inputs**

* **Paired Input Problem:** The core task is to take the TF binding profiles of two genes (Gene A and Gene B) and predict whether they are co-expressed.  
* **Siamese Transformer Architecture:**  
  1. **Twin Towers:** The architecture will consist of two identical transformer encoder "towers" that share weights. This weight sharing ensures that both gene promoter profiles are processed by the exact same feature extraction logic, which is crucial for learning comparable representations.29  
  2. **Input to Towers:**  
     * The input to Tower A will be the sequence of 50bp window TF summary vectors for Gene A's promoter (generated in step III.B.5). This sequence will have dimensions (num\_windows\_A, num\_TFs).  
     * Similarly, the input to Tower B will be the sequence of TF summary vectors for Gene B's promoter, with dimensions (num\_windows\_B, num\_TFs). (Note: num\_windows\_A and num\_windows\_B will be the same if all promoters have the same length and windowing parameters).  
  3. **Promoter Embedding:** Each transformer tower will process its input sequence of window vectors. The output of each tower will be a fixed-size embedding vector that represents the entire promoter's TF binding landscape, contextualized by the learned "TF vocabulary" and their arrangement. This promoter embedding can be derived from:  
     * The hidden state corresponding to a special \`\` (classification) token prepended to the input sequence (a common practice in BERT-like models).  
     * An aggregation (e.g., mean pooling or max pooling) of all the output hidden states from the transformer's final layer.  
* **Encoding TF Binding Profiles & "Vocabulary" within each Tower:**  
  1. **Input Sequence:** As described, each tower receives a sequence of vectors, where each vector is of length num\_TFs (e.g., \~300), representing a 50bp window.  
  2. **Linear Projection (Optional):** The num\_TFs-dimensional vector for each window can be passed through a linear layer (an input embedding layer) to project it into the transformer's hidden dimensionality (e.g., 256 or 512). This allows the model to learn a richer representation for each window summary.  
  3. **Positional Encoding:** Standard sinusoidal positional encodings or learned positional embeddings must be added to the sequence of window vectors (after the optional linear projection). This is essential for the transformer to understand the order and relative positions of the 50bp windows within the promoter.  
* **Combining Paired Representations for Prediction:**  
  1. Once the two transformer towers have produced fixed-size embedding vectors for Gene A (vA​) and Gene B (vB​), these two vectors need to be combined to make a co-expression prediction.  
  2. **Combination Strategies:** Several strategies can be employed:  
     * **Concatenation:** Concatenate vA​ and vB​ into a single vector: $$.  
     * **Element-wise Difference:** Compute the absolute element-wise difference: ∣vA​−vB​∣. This captures how dissimilar the two promoter embeddings are.  
     * **Element-wise Product:** Compute the element-wise product: vA​⊙vB​.  
     * **Combination:** A common approach is to use a combination, e.g., concatenating vA​, vB​, and ∣vA​−vB​∣.  
  3. **Classifier Head:** The combined vector is then fed into a final feed-forward neural network (the classifier head). This typically consists of one or more dense layers with non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU or GeLU), followed by a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation function. The sigmoid output will produce a probability (between 0 and 1\) that Gene A and Gene B are co-expressed.

This Siamese architecture directly models the relationship between the two genes' promoter characteristics. The shared weights in the transformer encoders force the model to learn to extract features from promoter TF profiles that are consistently relevant for comparing two promoters. This is a more direct and focused approach than, for example, learning individual embeddings for all genes and then trying to predict co-expression from those embeddings without an explicit paired comparison mechanism during feature extraction.

**2\. Transformer Model Architecture Design (Details for each Tower and Classifier Head)**

* **Transformer Encoder Block (per Tower):** Each tower will be composed of multiple standard transformer encoder blocks. Each block typically contains:  
  * **Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) Layer:** This layer allows each window vector in the input sequence to attend to all other window vectors in the same sequence, capturing dependencies and contextual information across the promoter. Multiple heads allow the model to focus on different aspects of these relationships simultaneously.  
  * **Feed-Forward Network (FFN):** A position-wise fully connected feed-forward network, usually consisting of two linear layers with a non-linear activation (e.g., ReLU or GeLU) in between.  
  * **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections:** Applied around both the MHSA and FFN components to stabilize training and improve gradient flow.  
* **Key Hyperparameters for the Transformer Towers:**  
  * **Number of Encoder Layers (Depth):** E.g., 2, 4, 6\. Deeper models can capture more complex patterns but are harder to train and prone to overfitting.  
  * **Number of Attention Heads (in MHSA):** E.g., 4, 8\. Must be a divisor of the embedding dimension.  
  * **Embedding Dimension / Hidden Size (dmodel​):** The dimensionality of the window embeddings and the internal representations within the transformer (e.g., 128, 256, 512).  
  * **Feed-Forward Layer Dimension (dff​):** The inner dimension of the FFN (typically 4×dmodel​).  
  * **Dropout Rate:** Applied within the attention mechanism and FFNs for regularization (e.g., 0.1, 0.2).  
* **Classifier Head:**  
  * **Input:** The combined vector from the two promoter embeddings.  
  * **Architecture:** Typically 1 to 3 dense (fully connected) layers.  
    * Hidden layer sizes (e.g., 256, 128).  
    * Activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GeLU).  
    * Dropout for regularization.  
  * **Output Layer:** A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to output the co-expression probability.

Table 2 provides a structured overview of key model configuration parameters and potential search spaces for hyperparameter tuning. This will guide the experimental phase of model development.

**Table 2: Transformer Model Configuration Parameters and Search Space**

| Parameter | Search Range/Values | Justification/Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Transformer Tower** |  |  |
| Number of Encoder Layers | 2, 4, 6 | Common range for sequence modeling tasks; balance capacity and overfitting.11 |
| Number of Attention Heads | 4, 8 | Must divide embedding dimension; typical choices. |
| Embedding Dimension (dmodel​) | 128, 256, 512 | Balances representational power and computational cost. |
| Feed-Forward Dimension (dff​) | 4×dmodel​ | Standard practice in transformer architectures. |
| Dropout Rate (Attention, FFN) | 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 | Regularization to prevent overfitting. |
| Input Projection Layer (Window) | Yes/No, Dim if Yes (e.g., dmodel​) | Optional layer to project TF summary vectors to dmodel​. |
| **Classifier Head** |  |  |
| Number of Dense Layers | 1, 2, 3 | Sufficient for classification from learned embeddings. |
| Hidden Layer Sizes | 64, 128, 256 | Standard choices for classifier heads. |
| Activation Function | ReLU, GeLU | Common non-linearities. |
| Dropout Rate (Classifier) | 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 | Regularization for the classifier part. |
| **Training Parameters** |  |  |
| Optimizer | Adam, AdamW | Standard optimizers for deep learning. AdamW often preferred for transformers. |
| Learning Rate | 1e−5, 5e−5, 1e−4, 5e−4 | Critical hyperparameter; requires tuning. |

| Learning Rate Scheduler | ReduceLROnPlateau, CosineAnnealing | Helps in fine-tuning learning rate during training. |
| Weight Decay | 1e−2, 1e−3, 0 | L2 regularization, particularly with AdamW. |

**3\. Training, Validation, and Performance Evaluation Strategy**

* **Data Splitting:**  
  * Divide the full dataset of gene pairs (from III.B.4) into training, validation, and testing sets. A common split is 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing.  
  * **Crucial Consideration:** To rigorously assess generalization to new genes, ensure that there is no gene overlap between the training, validation, and test sets. This means if a gene (e.g., AT1G01010) appears in any pair in the test set, it should not appear in any pair in the training or validation sets. This is more stringent than just ensuring pair non-overlap. If this is too restrictive given the dataset size, an alternative is to ensure that if a pair (A,B) is in test, neither A nor B were part of *any* pair in training/validation, or at least that the specific pair (A,B) was not. Chromosome-based splitting (e.g., holding out all pairs involving genes from one chromosome for testing) can also be considered for a stringent test of generalization.  
* **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss is appropriate for this binary classification task (co-expressed vs. not co-expressed).  
  * L=−\[y⋅log(p)+(1−y)⋅log(1−p)\], where y is the true label (0 or 1\) and p is the model's predicted probability.  
* **Optimizer:** Adam or AdamW \[Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019\] (Adam with decoupled weight decay) are recommended. AdamW is often preferred for training transformers.  
* **Learning Rate Scheduler:** Employ a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training. Options include:  
  * ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduce learning rate when a metric (e.g., validation loss or AUPRC) stops improving.  
  * CosineAnnealingLR: Gradually anneal the learning rate following a cosine schedule.  
* **Performance Metrics:**  
  * **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC):** This is a key metric, especially given the potential class imbalance due to the "possibly incomplete" nature of positive labels and the negative sampling strategy. AUPRC is more informative than AUC-ROC when the positive class is rare or more important.  
  * **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.  
  * **Precision (Positive Predictive Value):** TP/(TP+FP).  
  * **Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate):** TP/(TP+FN).  
  * **Accuracy:** (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN). Can be misleading with imbalanced classes.  
  * **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC):** While AUPRC is often preferred, AUC-ROC can also be reported.  
* **Handling Class Imbalance (due to negative sampling and incomplete positives):**  
  * **Weighted BCE Loss:** Assign a higher weight to the positive class (co-expressed pairs) in the BCE loss function if it is the minority class. The weight can be inversely proportional to class frequencies.  
  * **Negative Sampling Ratio:** As discussed in III.B.4, the ratio of negative to positive samples in training batches is a critical parameter to tune.  
  * **Metric Focus:** Prioritize AUPRC and F1-score for model selection and evaluation.  
* **Training Loop and Early Stopping:**  
  * Iterate through the training data in batches.  
  * After each epoch (or a set number of steps), evaluate the model on the validation set using the chosen metrics.  
  * Implement early stopping: Monitor a key validation metric (e.g., validation AUPRC or validation loss). If the metric does not improve for a predefined number of epochs ("patience"), stop training to prevent overfitting and save the model weights that achieved the best validation performance.

## **D. Visualization and Interpretation of Model Outputs**

Beyond predictive accuracy, understanding *why* the model makes certain predictions is crucial for deriving biological insights.

* **Performance Visualization:**  
  * Plot training and validation loss curves over epochs to monitor for convergence and overfitting.  
  * Plot training and validation AUPRC (and other key metrics) over epochs.  
  * Generate ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves for the test set to visualize overall performance.  
* **Attention Map Analysis (for interpretability):**  
  * The self-attention mechanisms within the transformer towers learn to assign "attention weights" to different input elements (the 50bp window summary vectors).  
  * For a given gene pair predicted to be co-expressed (or not), extract and visualize these attention weights from the transformer encoders.  
  * **Visualization:** For each gene in the pair, this could be a heatmap overlaid on the promoter region, where the intensity of color at each 50bp window position reflects the attention score it received. This can highlight which parts of the promoter (and thus which TF binding activities within those local windows) the model deemed most important for characterizing that gene's regulatory profile in the context of the co-expression prediction. This provides insights into the learned "TF vocabulary" and its positional significance, similar to how T-GEM's interpretability was leveraged.12  
* **Feature Importance (Advanced):**  
  * If feasible and tools are adaptable, explore methods like Integrated Gradients or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of specific input features (e.g., the binding signal of a particular TF within an important 50bp window) to the final co-expression prediction. This can be computationally intensive for transformers.  
* **Predicted Co-expression Network Visualization:**  
  * Use the model's predictions on a large set of gene pairs (e.g., all possible pairs or a representative subset) to construct a weighted co-expression network. Nodes are genes, and edges represent predicted co-expression relationships, with edge weights corresponding to the model's confidence score.  
  * Visualize this network using tools like Cytoscape. Analyze network topology, identify densely connected modules (potential functional complexes or pathways), and find hub genes (highly connected genes that might be key regulators).  
* **Comparison with Known Biological Knowledge:**  
  * For highly confident predicted co-expressed gene pairs (especially novel ones not in the original training TSV), investigate whether these genes are known to be involved in the same biological pathways (e.g., using GO term enrichment analysis on predicted modules), share functional annotations, or have literature evidence supporting their interaction or co-regulation in *A. thaliana*. This provides biological validation for the model's predictions.

# IV. Managing Computational Scale and Performance

# 

The scale of genomic data and the computational demands of deep learning models necessitate careful planning for efficient processing and resource management.

## **A. Strategies for Efficient Processing of Large-Scale Genomic Datasets**

The primary datasets involved include the *A. thaliana* genome, its GFF3 annotation, \~300 DAP-seq bigWig files, and co-expression data for thousands of genes.

* **Data Chunking and Streaming:**  
  * During initial data extraction phases (e.g., parsing GFF3 files, reading bigWig signals for promoter regions), it is crucial to avoid loading entire large files into memory if not necessary.  
  * For GFF parsing, libraries like Biopython allow for iterative parsing, processing records one by one or in chunks.39 This is essential for large annotation files.  
  * When extracting TF binding signals from bigWig files, process genes (or their promoters) in batches. For each batch of promoters, iterate through the \~300 TF bigWig files, extract signals for those promoters, and then move to the next batch.  
  * Utilize memory-efficient data structures provided by pandas and NumPy. For instance, specify appropriate dtypes for DataFrame columns to reduce memory footprint (e.g., using float32 instead of float64 if precision allows, or categorical types for gene IDs).  
* **Intermediate Data Storage Formats:**  
  * After significant processing steps, save intermediate results in efficient binary formats rather than text-based formats like CSV/TSV for faster subsequent loading.  
  * For numerical arrays (e.g., normalized TF binding matrices per gene, sequences of TF vocabulary vectors), NumPy's .npy or .npz (for multiple arrays) formats are highly efficient.  
  * For tabular data (e.g., processed gene lists, final training datasets), pandas offers support for formats like Feather or Parquet, which are significantly faster for I/O operations than CSV and often more compressed.  
* **Optimized Library Usage:**  
  * Leverage the fact that many core functions in libraries like pyBigWig, NumPy, and pandas are implemented in C or Cython, providing substantial speedups over pure Python implementations for performance-critical operations.  
* **Lazy Loading for Model Training:**  
  * When using PyTorch's Dataset and DataLoader classes (or their TensorFlow equivalents) for feeding data to the model, implement lazy loading. This means that data for a specific batch is loaded from disk (e.g., from the saved .npy files of TF vocabulary sequences) only when that batch is requested by the DataLoader. This avoids pre-loading the entire potentially massive training dataset into RAM.

The modularity inherent in the proposed data processing pipeline (GFF parsing → Promoter extraction → TF signal extraction → Normalization → TF vocabulary generation) naturally supports distributed computing and checkpointing. Each stage produces well-defined intermediate files. This design means that if a particular step fails due to resource constraints or an unexpected interruption, the workflow can be resumed from the last successfully completed stage without re-running everything from the beginning. Furthermore, different stages of this pipeline may have varying computational demands (e.g., some might be I/O-bound while others are CPU-bound). This modularity, coupled with batch processing (e.g., per chromosome or per defined set of genes), allows for potentially distributing different stages or batches across different compute nodes in a cluster, significantly enhancing scalability and robustness, especially as the project might expand to include more TFs, genes, or even additional species in the future.

## **B. Leveraging Parallel Computing and GPU Acceleration**

To handle the computational workload effectively, parallel processing strategies should be employed for data preprocessing, and GPU acceleration is essential for model training.

* **Data Preprocessing Parallelization:**  
  * Many of the data preprocessing steps outlined in Section III.B are "embarrassingly parallel," meaning they can be broken down into independent sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently with minimal inter-process communication.  
  * **Promoter Extraction & Signal Quantification:** The extraction of promoter sequences and TF binding signals can be parallelized per gene or per chromosome. Python's multiprocessing module or higher-level libraries like joblib can be used to distribute these tasks across multiple CPU cores. For instance, a pool of worker processes can be created, each responsible for processing a subset of genes or a subset of TF bigWig files for all genes.  
  * Some bioinformatics tools, like those in the deepTools suite (which includes bigwigAverage 53 and tools like bamCoverage and bamCompare 52 often used for bigWig generation from BAMs), have built-in options for parallel processing that could be leveraged if command-line tools are wrapped in Python scripts.  
* **GPU Acceleration for Transformer Model Training:**  
  * Training transformer models is computationally very intensive, primarily due to the matrix multiplications involved in the self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward layers. GPUs are specifically designed for such parallel computations and are indispensable for training these models efficiently.  
  * Both PyTorch and TensorFlow provide seamless integration with NVIDIA GPUs (via CUDA). The coding agent must ensure that the model and data tensors are explicitly moved to the GPU(s) for computation.  
  * **Multi-GPU Training:** If multiple GPUs are available on a single machine or across a cluster, their use can further accelerate training.  
    * In PyTorch, torch.nn.DataParallel can be used for simple multi-GPU training on a single node (though it has some limitations like GPU memory imbalance). torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel is the preferred method for more efficient multi-GPU and multi-node training, offering better performance and load balancing.  
    * TensorFlow offers tf.distribute.Strategy (e.g., MirroredStrategy for single-node multi-GPU, MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy for multi-node).  
* **Mixed Precision Training:**  
  * Consider using mixed precision training (e.g., using 16-bit floating-point numbers, float16 or bfloat16, for most computations and model weights, while maintaining certain critical parts like master weights in float32).  
  * Both PyTorch (via torch.cuda.amp) and TensorFlow provide utilities for automatic mixed precision (AMP). This can lead to significant speedups (up to 2-3x on compatible GPUs) and reduced GPU memory consumption, often with minimal or no loss in model accuracy. This allows for training larger models or using larger batch sizes.

The specific representation chosen for the "TF vocabulary" (as discussed in Section III.B.5) has direct and significant implications for the computational load during the model training phase. For example, if Method A, Option 1 (using flattened 50bp window signals) were chosen, it would result in either very long input sequences for the transformer or extremely high-dimensional feature vectors for each window. This would dramatically increase both the memory footprint and the computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism (which is typically quadratic with respect to sequence length and linear with respect to embedding dimension). In contrast, the recommended approach (Method A, Option 2: aggregated TF signals per window) produces more manageable sequences of num\_TFs-dimensional vectors. While Method A, Option 3 (learning embeddings for window patterns) introduces an additional upstream unsupervised learning step, it could potentially yield highly compact and informative vocabulary elements, possibly reducing the burden on the main transformer model. The current recommendation (Method A, Option 2\) represents a pragmatic balance between feature richness and computational feasibility. However, should model performance be suboptimal, exploring the more computationally intensive option of learned window embeddings might be a valuable avenue for future optimization. This highlights a critical trade-off between the complexity of upfront feature engineering and the demands placed on the downstream deep learning model.

## **C. Memory Management and Optimization**

* **Efficient Data Types:** Use the most memory-efficient data types in NumPy and pandas (e.g., np.float32 instead of np.float64 if full precision is not strictly necessary for TF signals).  
* **Deleting Unused Variables:** Explicitly delete large variables that are no longer needed using del var\_name and call gc.collect() to encourage Python's garbage collector to free up memory, especially in long-running scripts or Jupyter notebooks.  
* **Batch Processing in DataLoaders:** Ensure that DataLoader instances in PyTorch/TensorFlow are configured to load and process data in manageable batches, rather than attempting to load all data at once.  
* **Profiling:** If memory issues arise, use Python profiling tools (e.g., memory\_profiler) to identify memory bottlenecks in the code.

By proactively implementing these strategies, the coding agent can ensure that the project remains computationally tractable, even when dealing with the inherent scale and complexity of genome-wide TF binding data and deep learning models.

# V. Proactive Management of Data-Related Challenges

Genomic datasets are often characterized by various forms of noise, bias, and incompleteness. Proactively addressing these challenges is crucial for building a robust and reliable predictive model.

## **A. Addressing Noise and Biases in DAP-seq Data and TF Binding Signals**

DAP-seq, while powerful, is not immune to technical noise and biases that can affect the quantitative accuracy of TF binding signals.

* **Sources of Noise and Bias in DAP-seq:**  
  * **Non-specific Binding:** TFs may exhibit weak, non-specific interactions with DNA sequences that do not represent their canonical binding motifs. Additionally, both proteins and DNA fragments can non-specifically adhere to purification materials (e.g., beads, tubes), contributing to background signal.  
  * ***In Vitro*** **DNA Accessibility and Fragmentation Bias:** Although DAP-seq is performed *in vitro* and thus avoids biases from *in vivo* cellular chromatin structure, the input genomic DNA itself might possess sequence-dependent properties that influence the assay. For example, if the genomic DNA is fragmented prior to incubation with the TF, certain sequences might fragment more readily than others, leading to biases in representation. Some DNA regions might also be inherently "stickier" or more prone to non-specific interactions in the *in vitro* system.7  
  * **Sequencing Artifacts:** Standard Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) issues such as base calling errors, PCR amplification biases leading to duplicate reads, and errors in mapping reads to the reference genome can all introduce noise.  
  * **Batch Effects:** If DAP-seq experiments for different TFs (or replicates of the same TF) were performed in different batches, under slightly varying experimental conditions, or by different personnel, systematic batch effects could arise, making direct comparison of signals problematic.  
* **Mitigation Strategies During Preprocessing (referencing Section III.B.3):**  
  1. **Input Control Subtraction:** The most effective way to account for non-specific binding and regions of the genome that are generically "sticky" or prone to higher background in the DAP-seq procedure is to use an input control. This typically involves performing the DAP-seq protocol with the genomic DNA but without the specific TF (e.g., using beads alone or a mock purification). The signal from this input control can then be used to estimate and subtract the background noise from the TF-specific signal.50 This is a highly recommended practice.  
  2. **Read Quality Filtering and Deduplication:** Implement stringent read quality filtering (e.g., using tools like FastQC for assessment and Trimmomatic/Cutadapt for trimming low-quality bases and adapters) and remove PCR duplicates before mapping reads. This reduces noise originating from the sequencing process itself.  
  3. **Robust Normalization Methods:** Employ normalization techniques that can account for variations in sequencing depth and signal distributions across different TF datasets. As discussed in III.B.3, this includes library size normalization and potentially more advanced methods like quantile normalization or Z-score standardization per TF.50 These methods aim to make the signals quantitatively comparable.  
  4. **Filtering Low-Signal Regions or TFs:** TFs that show very sparse or weak binding across the vast majority of promoter regions might contribute more noise than meaningful biological signal. If such TFs do not demonstrably improve model performance during initial experiments, they could be considered for exclusion from the final model. Similarly, promoter regions with consistently low signal across all TFs might be filtered if they are deemed unreliable.  
* **Model-Based Mitigation:**  
  1. **Robust Model Architecture:** Deep learning models, particularly transformers with sufficient training data, can sometimes learn to down-weight or ignore noisy features if consistent patterns exist in the cleaner parts of the data.  
  2. **Regularization Techniques:** The use of dropout layers and weight decay (L2 regularization) in the transformer model architecture helps to prevent the model from overfitting to noisy patterns present in the training data.

## **B. Handling Missing Data in TF Profiles and Incomplete Co-expression Labels**

Missing data is a common issue in biological datasets and can arise in both the TF binding profiles and the co-expression labels.

* **Missing TF Binding Profiles:**  
  * **Problem:** DAP-seq data might not be successfully generated or available for all \~300 TFs for every gene's promoter region. This could be due to failed experiments, regions of the genome that are difficult to sequence or map, or simply incomplete datasets. This would result in missing values within the (Number of TFs x Promoter Length) signal matrices.  
  * **Solutions:**  
    1. **Imputation:**  
       * **Simple Imputation:** Replace missing values with the mean or median signal for that TF across all other gene promoters. While easy to implement, this can distort correlations and reduce variance.  
       * **Advanced Imputation:** Methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation (where missing values are inferred from similar genes based on their available TF binding profiles) or model-based imputation could be used. For example, an autoencoder could be trained on the available TF binding data to learn underlying patterns and then used to predict (impute) the missing signal values. Notably, GexBERT itself has been used for missing value imputation in gene expression datasets, demonstrating the potential of transformer-like architectures for this task.11  
    2. **Masking:** If imputation is deemed too unreliable or introduces too many assumptions, missing TF signals can be "masked." This involves replacing missing values with a specific placeholder value (e.g., \-1 or 0, provided the rest of the data is scaled appropriately so this value is distinct). The model might then learn to interpret this mask value as "missing information" and adjust its predictions accordingly.  
    3. **Exclusion:** If a particular TF has a very high percentage of missing data across most genes, it might be more prudent to exclude that TF from the analysis entirely. Similarly, if a gene's promoter has missing data for a large proportion of TFs, that gene might need to be excluded from the training/testing sets.  
  * The issue of missing TF profiles is particularly relevant before constructing the "TF vocabulary." If a TF's signal is missing in a 50bp window (not because it genuinely doesn't bind, but because the data is unavailable for that TF at that location), its absence would be incorrectly interpreted as non-binding when the vocabulary element for that window is generated. This underscores the need for imputation or masking strategies to be applied *before* or *during* the TF vocabulary construction step (III.B.5). The quality of imputation will directly influence the quality and interpretability of the learned TF vocabulary. If masking is used, the vocabulary elements and the downstream transformer will need to be able to accommodate these "unknown" or "masked" TF states within the local window summaries.  
* **Incomplete Co-expression Labels (False Negatives in Training):**  
  * **Problem:** As extensively discussed, the "possibly incomplete" nature of the co-expressed gene pairs TSV means that many true co-expression relationships might not be labeled as positive in the training data. If all unlabeled pairs are treated as negative examples, the training set will contain a significant number of false negatives, which can severely mislead the supervised learning process.32 This is arguably the most significant data challenge for this project, potentially more impactful than noise in the DAP-seq signals themselves, because it directly corrupts the supervisory signal the model learns from.  
  * **Solutions:**  
    1. **Robust Loss Functions and Training Schemes for Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL):**  
       * The field of LNL offers various techniques.54 Some methods involve trying to estimate the noise rates in the labels, while others use co-teaching approaches (e.g., training two networks simultaneously and having them filter potentially noisy samples for each other) to improve robustness.  
       * Research by Lee et al. (2023) on GO term prediction from co-expression data found that their neural network model was more robust to mis-annotated negative labels compared to older ML techniques, suggesting that neural networks, with appropriate design, can sometimes learn meaningful patterns even in the presence of label noise.32 Their strategy of ranking genes based on the sum of their connections to known positives is a way to leverage the sparse but more reliable positive signal.  
    2. **Careful Negative Sampling (Primary Strategy):** As detailed in Section III.B.4, the strategy for selecting negative gene pairs is paramount. Randomly sampling from the vast pool of unlabeled pairs, while controlling the positive-to-negative ratio, is a common starting point. The impact of this ratio should be evaluated.  
    3. **Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning:** It might be possible to frame the problem as PU learning, where the model learns from a set of positive examples and a set of unlabeled examples (which are a mix of true negatives and true positives). However, PU learning often requires specialized algorithms and assumptions that may or may not be suitable here.  
    4. **Focus on High-Precision Predictions:** Given the uncertainty in negative labels, it might be more realistic and valuable to optimize the model for high precision. That is, when the model predicts a pair of genes as co-expressed, there should be a high probability that they truly are. This might come at the cost of lower recall (missing some true co-expressed pairs), but the discovered relationships would be more reliable.  
    5. **Iterative Refinement (Advanced and Experimental):** In later stages, one could cautiously explore using very high-confidence co-expression predictions from an initial version of the model to augment the positive training set. This must be done with extreme care to avoid error propagation and confirmation bias.

## **C. Mitigating Bias in Training Data (Beyond Missing Labels)**

Other sources of bias in the training data can also affect model performance and generalization.

* **Sources of Bias:**  
  * **Gene Length / Promoter GC Content:** The length of actual transcribed regions or UTRs can vary, and GC content within promoter regions can differ. These factors might non-specifically influence TF binding or the efficiency of the DAP-seq assay itself, potentially creating correlations with co-expression that are not directly due to specific TF regulatory logic.  
  * **Highly Expressed Genes / Housekeeping Genes:** These genes often have distinct TF binding profiles at their promoters (e.g., enrichment of general TFs) and might be overrepresented in co-expression networks or datasets. If not handled carefully, the model might learn patterns specific to these gene classes rather than general rules of co-regulation.  
  * **Well-Studied vs. Poorly-Studied Genes:** The "known" co-expression data is likely to be more comprehensive and accurate for genes that have been extensively studied, while information for less-characterized genes might be sparser. This can lead to a bias in the training labels.  
* **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  1. **Normalization (as in III.B.3):** Robust normalization of TF binding signals helps to correct for some systematic technical biases related to signal intensity.  
  2. **Stratified Sampling for Validation/Test Sets:** When creating validation and test sets, ensure that they reflect the overall distribution of key gene characteristics (e.g., expression level categories, GC content quartiles, representation of different functional classes) if known. This helps to get a more reliable estimate of generalization performance.  
  3. **Bias-Aware Model Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the model's performance separately across different gene categories (e.g., performance on predicting co-expression for genes with high GC promoters vs. low GC promoters, or for highly expressed vs. lowly expressed genes). This can reveal if the model has learned biases.  
  4. **Data Augmentation (Limited Applicability):** While common in image or text processing, data augmentation is less straightforward for TF binding profiles. One could potentially explore adding small amounts of random noise to the input TF binding signals during training to improve model robustness, but this needs careful consideration to avoid obscuring true signals.

A summary of common genomic data issues and proposed mitigation strategies is presented in Table 3\. This table acts as a quick reference for the coding agent to anticipate and address potential data quality problems.

**Table 3: Common Genomic Data Issues and Proposed Mitigation Strategies**

| Issue Type | Potential Source/Cause | Proposed Mitigation Strategy (from pipeline) | Key Libraries/Techniques | Relevant References |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| DAP-seq Technical Noise/Bias | Non-specific binding, DNA fragmentation bias, sequencing depth variation, batch effects | Input control subtraction, library size normalization, robust signal scaling (e.g., Z-score), log transformation, quality control of reads. | pyBigWig, NumPy, custom normalization scripts. | 50 |
| Missing TF Data (in profiles) | Failed experiments, incomplete datasets, low-quality signal regions | Imputation (mean/median, KNN, model-based e.g., autoencoder), masking with a special value, exclusion of TFs/genes with excessive missingness. Applied *before* TF vocabulary generation. | scikit-learn (for KNNImputer), PyTorch/TensorFlow (for autoencoder imputation). | 11 |
| Incomplete Co-expression Labels | "Possibly incomplete" positive set leading to false negatives in training | Careful negative sampling strategies (control ratio), focus on AUPRC/Precision, consider LNL techniques or PU learning frameworks (advanced), iterative refinement (experimental). | pandas for sampling, scikit-learn for metrics, potentially specialized LNL libraries. | 32 |
| Bias from Gene Properties | Gene length, GC content, expression level (housekeeping genes) | Normalization, stratified sampling for test/validation, bias-aware model evaluation across gene categories. | scikit-learn for stratified splitting. |  |
| Overfitting to Training Data | Model complexity, noisy data, insufficient data | Regularization (dropout, weight decay), early stopping based on validation performance, robust feature engineering (TF vocabulary). | PyTorch/TensorFlow (for dropout, optimizers with weight decay). |  |

# VI. Future Outlook: Enhancing Model Generalizability

The successful development of a co-expression prediction model for *A. thaliana* based on TF binding profiles opens avenues for future enhancements, particularly in terms of generalizing the model to other plant species and integrating richer contextual information from single-cell datasets.

## **A. Considerations for Adapting the Model to Other Plant Species**

Extending the predictive model to other plant species is a valuable long-term goal, but it presents several significant challenges:

* **Genomic Differences:** Plant genomes vary widely in size, gene content, the structure of promoter regions, and the prevalence and types of repetitive elements. These differences can impact the direct applicability of promoter definitions and feature extraction methods developed for *A. thaliana*.  
* **TF Divergence and Function:** Transcription factors, including their DNA-binding domains and the specific motifs they recognize, can diverge evolutionarily across species.56 An orthologous TF in a different plant species may not bind to the exact same set of DNA sequences or regulate the same cohort of target genes. The PTFSpot model, for example, explicitly attempts to address this by learning the covariability between TF structure and DNA binding preferences across species, highlighting the importance of considering TF evolution.37  
* **Data Availability:** Comprehensive TF binding data, equivalent to the DAP-seq datasets available for *A. thaliana*, may be sparse or entirely unavailable for many TFs in other, less-studied plant species. Similarly, reliable co-expression datasets for training might be limited.

Despite these challenges, several strategies can be explored for model adaptation:

1. **Transfer Learning:**  
   * The model trained on *A. thaliana* data can serve as a pre-trained base. If some TF binding and co-expression data are available for a target species, the *A. thaliana* model can be fine-tuned on this new data. This approach leverages the knowledge learned from the data-rich model organism and adapts it to the target species. Transfer learning is a common strategy in deep learning and has been applied in genomics, for instance, by deepTFBS for TFBS prediction across species.22  
   * If the "TF vocabulary" is learned in the form of embeddings (e.g., for 50bp window patterns), these embeddings might capture some fundamental aspects of TF interactions or local DNA sequence properties that are at least partially conserved across related species.  
2. **Orthology-Guided Adaptation:**  
   * Identify orthologous relationships between *A. thaliana* TFs and genes and those in the target species. This information could be used to attempt a projection or mapping of TF binding profiles or learned "TF vocabulary" elements. However, this approach must be used cautiously, as orthology does not always guarantee conservation of function or binding specificity.  
3. **Development of Species-Agnostic Features:**  
   * To improve generalizability, future iterations could explore features that are less dependent on specific TF identities from a single species. For example, instead of using individual TF IDs, TFs could be grouped by family (based on DNA-binding domain structure) or by more abstract structural properties. The PTFSpot model's use of TF 3D structural information is a prime example of moving towards more species-agnostic representations.37  
4. **Cross-Species Data Integration:**  
   * If TF binding data for a few conserved TFs (e.g., those belonging to highly conserved families) exists across multiple species, this data could potentially be used to learn a "translation" model or an alignment of binding profiles, helping to bridge the gap between species.

The ability to generalize to other species will critically depend on the extent to which the "TF vocabulary" learned from *A. thaliana* DAP-seq captures conserved *cis*\-regulatory logic versus species-specific TF behaviors. DAP-seq, being sequence-centric, might help in identifying fundamental biochemical interaction rules of TF domains with DNA and with each other in local contexts. If these rules are partially conserved, the vocabulary might have some transferability, particularly to closely related plant species or for highly conserved TF families. However, if the vocabulary is too specific to *A. thaliana* TFs and their unique interactions, direct transfer will likely be challenging. This suggests that for robust cross-species generalization, incorporating more abstract features, such as TF family information or TF structural data (as in PTFSpot), could be a key future direction, rather than relying solely on TF IDs from a single reference species.

## **B. Integrating Single-Cell Data for Refined Co-expression Contexts**

Bulk tissue-level co-expression data, like that likely used for the initial training TSV, represents an average of gene expression relationships across all cell types present in the sampled tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a revolutionary leap in resolution by providing gene expression profiles at the level of individual cells. This allows for the dissection of cellular heterogeneity and the identification of cell-type-specific co-expression patterns and regulatory networks.2

**Potential Benefits of Integrating Single-Cell Data:**

1. **Contextualizing Co-expression Predictions:** The TF binding profiles derived from bulk DAP-seq are essentially static (representing *in vitro* potential). scRNA-seq can provide dynamic co-expression maps that vary across different cell types or cellular states. This information can be leveraged to:  
   * **Generate Cell-Type-Specific "Ground Truth":** scRNA-seq can be used to derive more precise, cell-type-specific co-expression labels. These could serve as refined training data for future model iterations or as context-specific validation sets for the current model's predictions.  
   * **Identify Context-Specific Activity of TF Vocabulary:** By correlating the activity of predicted "TF vocabulary" elements with cell-type-specific gene expression, it might be possible to determine which regulatory patterns are active or predictive in particular cellular contexts.  
2. **Linking TF Binding to Cell-Type Specific Regulation:**  
   * If single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), which profiles chromatin accessibility at the single-cell level, becomes available for relevant conditions, it could be integrated. scATAC-seq can reveal which genomic regions, including promoters containing DAP-seq identified TF binding sites, are accessible (and thus potentially active) in specific cell types.  
   * TF activity can sometimes be imputed from scRNA-seq data (e.g., based on the expression of a TF and its known target genes). This imputed TF activity, combined with the DAP-seq priors, could help understand how *in vivo* factors like chromatin accessibility and TF expression levels modulate the intrinsic binding preferences (captured by DAP-seq) to drive co-expression in different cell types.

**Challenges of Single-Cell Data Integration:**

* **Sparsity of scRNA-seq Data:** scRNA-seq data is often characterized by high levels of "dropouts" (zero counts for genes that may actually be expressed at low levels), which can complicate co-expression analysis.2  
* **Integration Complexity:** Methodologically, integrating bulk TF binding data (like DAP-seq) with single-cell gene expression data requires careful consideration. For example, DAP-seq signals are associated with genomic regions, while scRNA-seq provides expression per gene per cell. Mapping these data types and drawing meaningful correlations needs robust bioinformatics pipelines.  
* **Computational Scale:** Analyzing large-scale single-cell datasets is computationally intensive and requires specialized tools and expertise.

**Strategies for Integration:**

1. **Refined Training/Validation Sets:** Use scRNA-seq data to define cell-type-specific co-expression networks. These networks can then provide more nuanced and context-rich labels for training or evaluating the TF-binding-based co-expression model.  
2. **Contextual Interpretation:** If the current model predicts a general "potential" for co-expression based on DAP-seq TF binding patterns, scRNA-seq data could be used as a secondary filter or an interpretation layer to identify in which specific cell types or conditions these potential co-expression relationships are actually realized (i.e., where both genes are actively expressed and correlated).  
3. **Multi-Modal Models (Future Advanced Development):** Future iterations of the model could aim to directly incorporate features derived from single-cell data. For example, TF expression levels from scRNA-seq for different cell types could be used as additional input features to modulate the interpretation of the static DAP-seq binding signals, potentially leading to cell-type-aware co-expression predictions.

Single-cell data offers a powerful avenue to dissect the "many-to-many" problem in gene regulation. A single TF binding profile (derived from bulk DAP-seq) represents an average or potential landscape. However, this same landscape might lead to different co-expression outcomes in different cell types due to variations in the availability of cell-type-specific co-factors, differing chromatin states, or active signaling pathways. For instance, a particular promoter TF binding pattern might drive co-expression of gene X with gene Y in cell type A, but with gene Z in cell type B, or result in no specific co-expression in cell type C. Single-cell RNA-seq can deconvolve these distinct, cell-type-specific co-expression networks. This implies that future models, enhanced by single-cell data, might move beyond predicting a single binary "co-expressed / not co-expressed" label. Instead, they could aim to predict a vector of co-expression probabilities across a range of defined cell types, or the model could be trained and evaluated using cell-type-specific co-expression data derived from scRNA-seq. Such an advancement would make the predictions far more nuanced, dynamic, and biologically relevant, bringing us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the context-dependent nature of gene regulatory networks. The current DAP-seq based model would predict a "potential" for co-regulation based on the underlying TF binding grammar, and scRNA-seq would reveal where and when this potential is actualized within the organism.

**VII. Synthesis and Actionable Directives**

This report has outlined a comprehensive plan for developing a transformer-based model to predict gene co-expression in *Arabidopsis thaliana* using TF binding profiles from DAP-seq data. The core strategy involves defining promoter regions, extracting quantitative TF binding signals, normalizing these signals, and then engineering features representing a "TF vocabulary" based on local (50bp window) TF binding patterns. A Siamese transformer architecture is proposed to process paired gene promoter profiles and predict their likelihood of co-expression, trained on a known, albeit possibly incomplete, set of co-expressed gene pairs. The plan also incorporates strategies for managing computational scale, addressing data-related challenges such as noise and missing information, and outlines future directions for model generalization.

**Key Recommendations for the Coding Agent:**

1. **Prioritize Modular Code Design:** Implement the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, in a modular fashion. This will greatly facilitate debugging, allow for easier re-runs of specific pipeline stages, and make future modifications or extensions more manageable. Each module should have well-defined inputs and outputs.  
2. **Implement Thorough Logging:** Incorporate comprehensive logging at every significant step of the data processing and model training pipeline. This should include information about parameters used, shapes of data structures, intermediate results, errors encountered, and processing times. Robust logging is invaluable for troubleshooting and ensuring reproducibility.  
3. **Adopt an Iterative Development Approach:** Begin with the simplest effective methods for complex steps, such as the generation of the TF vocabulary (e.g., using aggregated TF signals per window as recommended) and the strategy for negative sampling. Evaluate these initial approaches thoroughly. More complex solutions should only be pursued if justified by a clear need or significant performance improvements on the validation set.  
4. **Focus on Robust Handling of Incomplete Labels:** The "possibly incomplete" nature of the co-expressed gene pair training data is a central challenge. The coding agent must place significant emphasis on implementing and evaluating robust negative sampling strategies. The choice of negative samples will profoundly impact model training and interpretation. Evaluation should prioritize metrics like AUPRC that are less sensitive to a high number of true negatives in an imbalanced dataset.  
5. **Meticulous Documentation for Reproducibility:** Document all code, algorithmic choices, software versions, parameter settings, and data sources meticulously. This is paramount for ensuring the reproducibility of the results and for allowing others (or future self) to understand and build upon the work.  
6. **Leverage Existing Libraries:** Utilize well-maintained, established bioinformatics and machine learning libraries (as listed in Table 1\) wherever possible. This avoids reinventing the wheel, reduces development time, and benefits from the optimizations and community vetting these libraries have undergone.  
7. **Systematic Model Development and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Plan for an iterative cycle of model development, training, and hyperparameter tuning. Use the designated validation set to guide all choices regarding model architecture, training parameters (as outlined in Table 2), and feature engineering decisions. Employ systematic search strategies for tuning (e.g., grid search, random search, or more advanced Bayesian optimization if resources permit).  
8. **Emphasize Model Interpretability:** While predictive accuracy is important, strive to incorporate methods for interpreting the model's decisions, such as attention map analysis. Gaining insights into which TF binding patterns or promoter regions the model considers important will significantly enhance the biological value of the project beyond black-box prediction.

**Concluding Remarks:**

The project detailed herein holds considerable potential to advance our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying gene co-regulation in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. By combining state-of-the-art DAP-seq TF binding data with sophisticated deep learning techniques like transformer models, and by innovatively focusing on a learned "TF vocabulary," this work can uncover novel regulatory principles. Successfully addressing the inherent challenges, particularly those related to data quality and incompleteness, will be key to realizing this potential. The resulting model and the biological insights derived could serve as a valuable resource for the plant science community and lay a robust foundation for future research into gene regulatory networks across diverse plant species and cellular contexts.
